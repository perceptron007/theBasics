## What to Expect ?
* I'll be following the approach to finish the tutorial alongside also learning all the side knowledge to make sense of what is happening in the code.
* I'll create side branches for different things i'll learn i'll try to attach code to them too so those those make sense to you too.
* I'll try to make the course in a time travel way where you will start from lesson 1 along side different things will start including in the code.
